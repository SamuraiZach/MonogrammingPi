The code displays my initials in order from first to last name, first a Z will appear and pause to then clear and have a B appear.
Lastly, after the B disappears a clover will appear then pause to then disappear again. The board is clean at the end then the program ends.

Compile using:

cc -o zbarraza project.c -L ~/lib -I ~/include -lsense

To compile and view on cisc210, add the flag '-lncurses' to the above.
